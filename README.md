# Project-Cleanup
This script cleans up unused sprites and audio files from Fraytools projects. It takes all of these files and creates a new folder called "cleanup" where these unused files can then be reviewed prior to deletion.

# How to use
Simply select a Fraytools project folder that you wish to clean with the folder browse button! If the folder is deemed to be valid, then the program will parse through the files and remove anything that is not used by the character (aka bye bye Frankyie)
The program does take some time to execute especially for larger projects so please be patient.

# Steps
1. Download the program from the Github page.
2. Extract the contents found in the folder Exe Version/Project Cleanup V1.0.zip (If you want to use/view the python code, look at the Python Code file)
3. Run the .exe that should be called something like Project Cleanup V1.0.exe
4. Choose the project folder that you want to clean: (In my case I'm cleaning the Project named "Dudley - Copy")

6. Choose any extra options (I don't rellay recommend using Advanced Audio as its limited in scope and may cause more harm than good)
7. Run the program!!

8. If the program ran successfully, it should display some statistics:

9. View all the removed content in the new "cleanup" folder generated by the program

# Batch Clean
Batch clean basically follows the same steps listed above except you choose a parent folder that hosts multiple projects rather than one.

# Options
This program does have a few options such as batch cleanup and advanced audio cleanup.

## Advanced audio cleanup
This method attempts to clean unused audio files by looking at a users code along with CharacterStats.hx file to determine what audio is used in the proejct. Any unused audio will be removed.
Since this is attempting to parse code, there will be errors since there are a million ways to play audio in Fraytools, hence why this is listed as experimental and should be used at your own RISK!!
